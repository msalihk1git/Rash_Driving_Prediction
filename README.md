Problem description:
You are tasked with developing a machine learning model that predicts rash driving behavior of bike riders using mobile app sensor and location data. The dataset provided to you contains information such as accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, speed, and timestamp data. Your task is to build a model that takes in this data and predicts whether the rider is driving recklessly or not.
Task:
1.	Conduct a brief research on similar projects, identify their limitations and suggest how to overcome them.
2.	Create a machine learning model that can predict rash driving behavior based on the dataset provided. You can use any machine learning algorithm you find suitable. However, please justify your choice of algorithm.
3.	Evaluate your model's performance using relevant metrics and explain how you arrived at your chosen metrics. Also, provide suggestions for improving your model's performance.
4.	Finally, summarize your findings and provide a conclusion on the feasibility of developing a rash driving detection system.
